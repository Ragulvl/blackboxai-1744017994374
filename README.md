# NetSpeed - Internet Speed Test

## Project Overview
NetSpeed is a simple, fast, and accurate internet speed testing application designed to provide users with a seamless experience when checking their internet connection speed. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, NetSpeed features an interactive interface with a speedometer-like display for both download and upload speeds, along with a history of past tests.
